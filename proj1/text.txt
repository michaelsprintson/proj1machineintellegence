We had lots of fun with the 8-Queens problem. In this project you will implement several search and constraint optimization algorithms for generating solutions to the 8-Queens problem. Implement four of your favorite algorithms for solving the 8-Queens problem using any language you like. Diversity in chosen search algorithms is expected. Compare their performance using appropriate metrics.
